title: DCAT-NFDI-AP-SOSA
description: |-
  DCAT-NFDI-AP extension that declares the research activity which generated a Dataset to a SOSA:Observation. This 
  allows us to use classes and relations from SOSA that are generally applicable for a broad range of Observations. 
  This is just a first, as this profile could be using more terms from SOSA to describe an Observation.

    description: |-
      A workflow, protocol, plan, algorithm, or computational method specifying how to make an Observation, create a Sample, or make a change to the state of the world (via an Actuator). A Procedure is re-usable, and might be involved in many Observations, Samplings, or Actuations. It explains the steps to be carried out to arrive at reproducible results.
