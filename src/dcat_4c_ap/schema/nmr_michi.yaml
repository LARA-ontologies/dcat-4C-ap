title: "MARGARITAS: MIChI Standard for Reporting Liquid-State NMR Experiments of Small Molecules"
description: 'MARGARITAS stands for "Michi stAndard foR reportinG liquid-stAte nmR experImenTs of smAll moleculeS". This MIChI standard is a proposal from NFDI4Chem to outline essential metadata required for documenting liquid-state NMR experiments of small molecules. We aim to make it suitable for NMR repositories and the supplementary materials of publications. The standard consists of two parts: tabular recommendations that include the actual checklist of properties and textual guidelines explaining the meaning and use of the checklist. We actively maintain and optimise our MIChI, which results in new versions. Below, you can find all the available versions. Please use the last one.'

      - This class serves as an example for the way in which we want to build domain specific schema profiles. It will be outsourced to a more appropriate location in the future.

  # This is a [dynamic LinkML Enum definition](https://linkml.io/linkml/schemas/enums.html#dynamic-enums) covering
  # pulsed NMR spectroscopy types defined in the Chemical Methods Ontology (CHMO). It was expanded (made static) using
  # OAK with `poetry run vskit expand -s src/dcat_4c_ap/schema/dcat-4C-ap.yaml -o src/dcat_4c_ap/schema/chmo-nmr-assay-enum.yaml`.
  # and then copying only the enum into this schema manually.
