      magnetic field are interrogated by inducing transitions between the states via
      radio frequency irradiation. Each experiment consists of a sequence of radio
      frequency pulses with delay periods in between them.

    text: CHMO:0001119
    description: An NMR experiment used to measure self-diffusion coefficients via
      signal attenuation which occurs due to diffusion during the application of pulsed
      field gradients. This experiment also corrects for the effects of imperfect
      pulsed field gradients.

    text: CHMO:0000910
    description: 'A two-dimensional NMR experiment which exploits the differential
      dipolar couplings which nuclei exhibit to their neighboring protons within local
      magnetic fields. The experiment consist of two time intervals: during the first
      time period the dipolar couplings are encoded in the NMR signal, while in the
      detection period the signals of different nuclei are separated on the basis
      of their differences in chemical shift.'

    text: CHMO:0000592
    description: Spectroscopy where the energy states of spin-active nuclei placed
      in a static magnetic field are interrogated by inducing transitions between
      the states via radio frequency irradiation. Each experiment consists of a sequence
      of radio frequency pulses with delay periods in between them, and the spectrum
      is obtained by plotting chemical shift vs. frequency.
