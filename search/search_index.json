A Procedure is re-usable, and might be involved in many Observations, Samplings, or Actuations. It explains the steps to be carried out to arrive at reproducible results.\" Attribute A piece of information that is attributed to an entity of interest, tool or environment. InChi A structure descriptor which conforms to the InChI format specification. InChIKey None IUPACName An IUPAC name is a systematic name which is formulated according to the rules and recommendations for chemical nomenclature set out by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). QuantifiableAttribute An attribute that is quantifiable. Dataset A collection of data, published or curated by a single agent, and available for access or download in one or more representations. DatasetCollection A curated collection of metadata about data resources. NMRDataset None ObservationDataset A collection of data, published or curated by a single agent, and available for access or download in one or more representations. DefinedTerm A word, name, acronym, phrase that is defined in a controlled vocabulary (CV) and that is used to provide the rdf:type of an entity within this schema. EntityOfInterest Something that is being evaluated in a scientific process. ChemicalReaction An experimental procedure with the aim of producing a portion of a given compound or mixture. ChemicalSubstance A chemical substance that is being evaluated in a scientific process. FeatureOfInterest The thing whose property is being estimated or calculated in the course of an Observation to arrive at a Result or whose property is being manipulated by an Actuator, or which is being sampled or transformed in an act of Sampling. Environment The environment in which the dataset creating Observation took place (e.g. a lab). Laboratory A facility that provides controlled conditions in which scientific or technological research, experiments, and measurement may be performed. ResearchActivity An activity (process) that has the objective to produce information about an entity by evaluating it. NMRSpectroscopy Spectroscopy where the energy states of spin-active nuclei placed in a static magnetic field are interrogated by inducing transitions between the states via radio frequency irradiation. Each experiment consists of a sequence of radio frequency pulses with delay periods in between them. Observation Act of carrying out an (Observation) Procedure to estimate or calculate a value of a property of a FeatureOfInterest. Links to a Sensor to describe what made the Observation and how; links to an ObservableProperty to describe what the result is an estimate of, and to a FeatureOfInterest to detail what that property was associated with. Tool A entity with a certain function used within a scientific activity. HardwareTool A hardware with a certain function. Sensor Device, agent (including humans), or software (simulation) involved in, or implementing, a Procedure. Sensors respond to a stimulus, e.g., a change in the environment, or input data composed from the results of prior Observations, and generate a Result. Sensors can be hosted by Platforms.
